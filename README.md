#psvg

psvg is a parametric SVG editor that lets you parameterize SVG files and swap out with user selectable values and calculations in a way that is similar to [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) but more interoperable with the 2d file formats used with laser cutters and CNC mills.

The original parametric-SVG-editor was written in 2011 by Harmen G. Zijp and Peter Uithoven. This is my attempt to modenize the code, make it a convenient client side application like [Morkdown](https://github.com/rvagg/morkdown), fix some bugs and add some new featues.
